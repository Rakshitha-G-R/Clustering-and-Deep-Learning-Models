# Clustering-and-Deep-Learning-Models

This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify and analyze 360 rock images across three categories (I, M, S). Key tasks include dimensionality reduction, clustering, and neural network-based classification.

## Key Components:

### Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization:
PCA to preserve 90% variance, reconstruct images, and visualize clusters.
t-SNE, LLE, and MDS for alternative cluster representations.
### Feature Comparison with Human Perception:
Procrustes Analysis compares machine-extracted and human-judged features.
### Clustering Methods:
K-Means & EM Clustering (preserving 90% variance), determining optimal clusters and evaluating accuracy.
Generating 20 synthetic rock images using EM sampling.
### Deep Learning Classification:
CNN-based model trained on 360 rock images, validated on 120 images.
Tracks training time, accuracy, and loss trends.
Feature comparison with human perception via Procrustes Analysis.
